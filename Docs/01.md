-`def greet(name)`  name is the parameter 
  - The parameter is the variable in the function .
  - The parameter are the empty container that we lable when creating the function .
- `greet("Alice")`  # "Alice" is an argument
  - The argument is the the actual value  which we pass to the function when we call it  .

# File handling 
- Basic of the file handling in the python .
  - File are open using the built-in open() function.
  -  Always close the file after using it to release the system  resources .
  - There are the few modes in the file opening 
    - 'r' Read modes(default), file must exit .
    - 'w' Write modes(default), create or overwrite(replace the existing content) the file .
    - 'a' Append mode ,adds content to the end of the file .
    - 'x' Fails if the file exists .
    - 'b' Binary for non-text files like images .
    - 't' text mode (defualt) works with the text files .
- Note to read any file it should be in the same directory .
 ```Python
 file =open('README.md','r')  # This will open the file present in the directory in the read mode 
content = file.read()        # This will read the entire contents of the file and store it into the vatiable name content . And this load the whole file at once . 
file.close()                 # This will close the file present in the read mode to ensure that it resource associated with file are released. 
print(content)               # This will print the content which is stored in the variable 
 ```

# Open function
- `open()` returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
a BufferedRandom.


# close function 
varibale name.close function
# read ()
```python
toy = open('03.md','r')
t=toy.read()
toy.close()  # This will close the file object
print(t) 
```
```python
you = open('03.md','w+')
you.write("This is the orange")
you.seek(0)   # This is  the method in the file handling to move the file pointer to a specific postion within the file. 
content=you.read()
print(content) 
you.close()
```
# readline()
# readlineS()
# write()
# writelines()
# tell()
# seek() 
 -  `file.seek(n)`         # Move the pointer to the nth byte
# mode 
# closed



# Functions 
- These are the one of the core concepts of the function which provides a to encapsulate resuable blocks of the code. They are used to improve the modularity,readability and efficiency of the code . 
```python
def k (name):
   return name    
let = 'l'
print(let)
print('This is the apple',k('Juice'))
```

- Parameter are the variable listed in the function defination to recive input values. They act as the plceholders for the values that the function will process .
```python
def k (name):  # Here k is the parameter 
    return name
```
- Arguments are the actual values provided to the function when it is called . These are the data passed to the function. 



# Exception handling 
- Exception handling is a mechanism in python to handle runtime errors the program does not crash  unexpectedly .
- Key terms 
  - Exception: Error detected during execution .
  - Try: The block where you write code that might raise an exception.
  - except: The block where you handle the exception .
  - else Code that runs if no exception is occurs 
  - finally: The code that always runs regardless of whether an exception occurs .
```python
try:
    print (10/10)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:  # As keyword allows you to capture the exception onject into the a varibale 
    print ("Error:", (e))
```
- There are few built in exception handlin provided by  the python itself : 
  - `ValueError`
     - A valueError in python is the builtin exception that  occurs when  a function  receives an argument  of the  the right type but with the invalid value .
     ```python
     try:
         a=int("T")
     except ValueError as e :
      print(f'Error: {e}')
     ```
  - `FileNotFoundError`
  - `KeyError`
  - `IndexError`
  - `TypeError`
  - `ValueError`
  - `Exception`
