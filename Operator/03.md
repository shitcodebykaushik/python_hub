# Python
- py file_name.py for runnig the python command .
- In python most of the things are with the stuff .
- Stuff stands for the objects . Python provides the powerfull objects types .
- Objects are the location of the memory that contain the data.
- Python is dynamically typesd which means that it keeps the track of the prpgramm automatically. In case we can perform the static type too according to our needs .
- We can print the code inthe str frindly way in the python .
```Python
len(str(2**1000))
print('hey')
print(3.1415*2)
```
- We can import the module to perform the operation more fast .
```Python
import random 
print(random.choice([1,2,3,4,8,3,8]))
import math
print (math.pi)
S ='Kaushik'
L = 'Raj'
M = S + L
K=S[-4]   # This will show the last 4th number from the last''' 
K=S[1:4] 
print(K)
print (M)
A = 'kaushi'
L =list (A)   # this will expand the variable into the list .
print(L)
S = "lalalalkdnfe"
L = S.find('d')
print(L)
S = 'kau,shik'
print (S)
M = S.replace('ik','hJ').split(',')
print (M)
```
- `Len` It is the built in function . Which return the total length of the variable . 
- Slicing is the way to extract an entire section in a single step .
- Python support the concetation of the two string value . which means that we can add the different string value together .
- Strings are immutable in the python .Most of the core types are immuatable (unchangable) .
- Python run from the left to right in the programm .
-  We can apply two different function in the one line of the code in the same variable .
```Python
S = 'kaushik'
T =dir (S)  # This is dir function which list the all attributes . This helps in the operator overloading in class,they represent the implentation of the string and the customization too .
print(T)
```
# Pattern Matching
- It is the one of the advanced tool of the text-processing .



# List 
- Python list may be reminiscent of array in the other language but they tend to be more powerful . 
- List are the positioned ordered collection of arbitrarily typed objects and they have the fixed size . These are the mutable . Arbitiary collection means not limited to the size .
- List support all the sequence .
- List dont have the fixed type constraints .
```python
l = [234,'wer','err',]
r =l*20
print (r)
```
- List have no fixed size .Still python doesnt allow us to reference items that are not present . 
- The core features of the python is the arbitary nesting .Which means that it can have list under the dictonary and vice-versa .
- 
```Python
print ('The realm is all your')

# Python Type specific operation . 
# In python we need to create the variable to assign the value in it .
# We are not changing the original value we are just assigning the data in it .
S = [1,2,46,78]
L = len(S)
O =S+[1,244,42]  # To add the new data into the varibale witht the old data available .
S.append('Puru') # To add the data at the end of the list .
S.pop (3)    # Removal of the element from the list with the help of the pop by assigning the index number .
S.reverse()
Y= [45.5,34,6,2]  # This sort the value into the ascending order .
Y.sort()
print(L)
print (S)
print(O)
print(Y) 
 # Nesting 
M = [[1,2,3],
      [5,6,7],
      [7,5,4]]
M.sort()
M.reverse()
M[1]
print(M)
print(M)
```
# Dictionaries
- It is completely different from the list as these are not in the sequence but in the mapping .
- Mappings are the collection of the other objects .
- In this mapping it map the key to associates the value.
- It is mutable in python .
- It is so flexible tool for collections but their mnemonic keys are better suited when collections items are named .
- Indexing key is fastest way to code a search in a python .
- Dictionaries can be made by using the keyword dict .
