# Python
- py file_name.py for runnig the python command .
- In python most of the things are with the stuff .
- Stuff stands for the objects . Python provides the powerfull objects types .
- Objects are the location of the memory that contain the data.
- Python is dynamically typesd which means that it keeps the track of the prpgramm automatically. In case we can perform the static type too according to our needs .
- We can print the code inthe str frindly way in the python .
```Python
len(str(2**1000))
print('hey')
print(3.1415*2)
```
- We can import the module to perform the operation more fast .
```Python
import random 
print(random.choice([1,2,3,4,8,3,8]))
import math
print (math.pi)
S ='Kaushik'
L = 'Raj'
M = S + L
K=S[-4]   # This will show the last 4th number from the last''' 
K=S[1:4] 
print(K)
print (M)
A = 'kaushi'
L =list (A)   # this will expand the variable into the list .
print(L)
S = "lalalalkdnfe"
L = S.find('d')
print(L)
S = 'kau,shik'
print (S)
M = S.replace('ik','hJ').split(',')
print (M)
```
- `Len` It is the built in function . Which return the total length of the variable . 
- Slicing is the way to extract an entire section in a single step .
- Python support the concetation of the two string value . which means that we can add the different string value together .
- Strings are immutable in the python .Most of the core types are immuatable (unchangable) .
- Python run from the left to right in the programm .
-  We can apply two different function in the one line of the code in the same variable .
```Python
S = 'kaushik'
T =dir (S)  # This is dir function which list the all attributes . This helps in the operator overloading in class,they represent the implentation of the string and the customization too .
print(T)
```
