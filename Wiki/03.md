# Python
- py file_name.py for runnig the python command .
- In python most of the things are with the stuff .
- In the python we have everyhting in the form of the objects .
- Stuff stands for the objects . Python provides the powerfull objects types .
- Objects are the location of the memory that contain the data.
- Python is dynamically typed which means that it keeps the track of the prpgramm automatically. In case we can perform the static type too according to our needs .
- We can print the code inthe str frindly way in the python .
# Flow control 
- It decide that which program should run under which conditions .
- In flow chart we always two way to perform the task .
- Elements of the flowchart are 
   - Conditions
   - Block of the code 
   - 
- In bollean we have two option only in our hand ,in case of int ans other data types we have multiple option .
- Boolean operator and or not are used to compare boolean values ,these expression breakdown the values into the booleabs level .
- # While 
- This means it will run until the conditon is truee .
- To break this we use the keyword `break`.
```Python
while False:
 v = 2+2
 print (v)
while True:
 a="Ram is boy"
 if a=='Ram is bo' :
  print("Yes")
 else :
  break

spam = 0 
while  spam <5:  # This loops keep runnig until the condition is truee . 
 print ('Heloo world .')
 spam = spam+1

# The two different flow control statement .
 spam = 0 
if  spam <5:
 print ('Heloo world .')
 spam = spam+1   #  Here the if conditon is running and it print the value omy once . 
```
# Loop
- for loop is use to run the task at the certain number of the time .
```Python
for i  in range (300):  # This is the simple for loop programm .  which will iterate over succeesive .
    print (i)
```
- While will executes as long as the code condition is true .
# Function 
- A function is like a mini prpgram within the program .
- A major purpose of the function is to group code that gets executed multipl-times.
- When we pass the value into the function is called arguments.
- A parameter is a varible that an argument is stored in when a function is called .
- Parameters and variables that are assigned in a called function are said to exist in that function local scope .
- Varibale that are asigned outside all fuctions are said to exist in the global scope .
- Scope is the container of the variable . When the scope is destroyed all the values are destroyed in it .
- Local variable cannot be used in the gloabl scope .
- Local scope can not be used in the other local scope .

```Python
def leap_year ():  # This line define the function name 
    print('Year')    # The line which follow the def statement are function body and these line will be execute when the function is call not when the function is defined
    print ('Month')
    print ('Date')
leap_year ()   # This is where the function is called .
def getAnswer (answerNumber):  # This is the parameter  which will store the value of the arguments 
    if answerNumber == 1:
        return "It is certain"
    elif answerNumber == 2:
        return "It is decidely so"
    elif answerNumber == 3:
        return 'Yes'
    answer=input(("Enter your name"))
print(getAnswer(3))   # This is the arguments as we have passed the value of 3 .
```
# Pointers 
- Pointers are the simply varibale that store the memory address of other variable or objects .
- It manages the code very well. 
- Pointers are primarly encouraged to make the implict modification rather than the explict changes .
- It is unclear that why we dont use the pointer in the python .
- Python doesnt have the explicts the pointers although they are implemented beneath the hood .

# Varibale 
- In python we dont have the varibale instead they are addressed by names .
```Python
len(str(2**1000))
print('hey')
print(3.1415*2)
```
- We can import the module to perform the operation more fast .
```Python
import random 
print(random.choice([1,2,3,4,8,3,8]))
import math
print (math.pi)
S ='Kaushik'
L = 'Raj'
M = S + L
K=S[-4]   # This will show the last 4th number from the last''' 
K=S[1:4] 
print(K)
print (M)
A = 'kaushi'
L =list (A)   # this will expand the variable into the list .
print(L)
S = "lalalalkdnfe"
L = S.find('d')
print(L)
S = 'kau,shik'
print (S)
M = S.replace('ik','hJ').split(',')
print (M)
```
- `Len` It is the built in function . Which return the total length of the variable . 
- Slicing is the way to extract an entire section in a single step .
- Python support the concetation of the two string value . which means that we can add the different string value together .
- Strings are immutable in the python .Most of the core types are immuatable (unchangable) .
- Python run from the left to right in the programm .
-  We can apply two different function in the one line of the code in the same variable .
```Python
S = 'kaushik'
T =dir (S)  # This is dir function which list the all attributes . This helps in the operator overloading in class,they represent the implentation of the string and the customization too .
print(T)
```
# Pattern Matching
- It is the one of the advanced tool of the text-processing .



# List 
- Python list may be reminiscent of array in the other language but they tend to be more powerful . 
- List are the positioned ordered collection of arbitrarily typed objects and they have the fixed size . These are the mutable . Arbitiary collection means not limited to the size .
- List support all the sequence .
- List dont have the fixed type constraints .
```python
l = [234,'wer','err',]
r =l*20
print (r)
```
- List have no fixed size .Still python doesnt allow us to reference items that are not present . 
- The core features of the python is the arbitary nesting .Which means that it can have list under the dictonary and vice-versa .
- 
```Python
print ('The realm is all your')

# Python Type specific operation . 
# In python we need to create the variable to assign the value in it .
# We are not changing the original value we are just assigning the data in it .
S = [1,2,46,78]
L = len(S)
O =S+[1,244,42]  # To add the new data into the varibale witht the old data available .
S.append('Puru') # To add the data at the end of the list .
S.pop (3)    # Removal of the element from the list with the help of the pop by assigning the index number .
S.reverse()
Y= [45.5,34,6,2]  # This sort the value into the ascending order .
Y.sort()
print(L)
print (S)
print(O)
print(Y) 
 # Nesting 
M = [[1,2,3],
      [5,6,7],
      [7,5,4]]
M.sort()
M.reverse()
M[1]
print(M)
print(M)
```
```Python
# Using concept of the loop and list we have printed the value in sequesnce way .
supplies = ["Car","Trucl","Bike"]
d="Car" in ["Cat","Trucl","Bike"]   # Use of in or not operator to determine wheather the value is in list or not .
c="Car" in  ["Car","Trucl","Bike"]
print (c)
for i in range (len(supplies)) :
    print("Index " + str(i) +  " in the supplies is :" + supplies[i])
# Using list to filter the name of the pet 
mypets = ['Cow','Dog', 'Rat']
print("Enter the pet name")
name =input()
if name not in mypets:
    print("I dont have the data of your pet "+ name)
else:
    print (name + "Here the data of your per")

# Assigning the multiple value 
myanimals = ['']
```
- Sort () method sort the list in place .
- Sort () uses the ASCIIbetical order rather then the actual alphabetica means it will first use the uppercase then the lower case ,
- You can sort list that have both the numbers values and string values in them .
- A list value is mutable .
- A list string is immuatable which can not be changed or modified . If we do so then it will give typeError .
```Python
# Sort in python 
love = ["kaushik","Kaushik"]
love.sort()
print (love)
# Mutable and Immuatable data types 
name = "The list string is immuatable"
print (name)
 # using slice we can mutate the string 
```
# Dictionaries
- It is completely different from the list as these are not in the sequence but in the mapping .
- Mappings are the collection of the other objects .
- In this mapping it map the key to associates the value.
- It is mutable in python .
- It is so flexible tool for collections but their mnemonic keys are better suited when collections items are named .
- Indexing key is fastest way to code a search in a python .
- Dictionaries can be made by using the keyword dict .
```Python
D= {'foood': 'Span', 'quantity': 4, 'color': 'pink'}  # This is formal represnetation of the dictonaries .
print (D)
D['quantity'] += 2  # Here we did the increament of the value 
print (D)
F = {}    # This is empty way of creating the data .
F['NAME'] = 'Kaushik'   # Creates a key by assignment operator .
F['job'] = 'Software dev'
F[' Age'] = '20'
print(F[' Age'])   # Printing the specific data .
y=dict(Name='Priyesh',Age='20',Job ='Software developer')  # Using dict keywords .
print(y)
```
# Tupples
- It is list in the python but it is the immuatable .
- It is use to represent the fixed collection of the items .
- Most of the time these are coded into the paranthese instead of the square brackets .
- The primary distinction of the tuple is that it cant be changed once it is created .
```Python
T = (1,2,3,4)
k=len (T)
print (k)
k=T.index(3)
k= T.count(2)
print(k)
print (T)
print(k)  # Till 170
```
# Statements 
- Statements are nothing but to tell python that what our program should do .
- Python is the composesd of the statements and expression .
- Expression process objects and are embded in a statements.
- Statement code are the larger logic of the program operation .
- Python is the language which is WYSIWYG which means that what you see is what you get .
```Python
 # A Tale of two ifs 
x=4
y=20
if (x>y) :
    x =1
    y=2
    print ( 'Yes the value is ok')   # The python indentation is one of the most imporatant things in the python .
else :
      print ( 'The value is not ok ')
```
